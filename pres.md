# In-Memory Database Project Presentation

## 1. Introduction
- **Project Name**: Redis-Clone
- **Objective**: Develop a lightweight, Redis-like in-memory data store to understand the mechanics of in-memory databases and provide a foundation for building high-performance applications.

## 2. Project Overview
- **Implementation Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Client Libraries**: JavaScript and Python
- **Additional Tools**: Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- **Deployment**: Dockerization for simplified usage and deployment

## 3. Key Features
- **Data Structures**:
  - **Strings**
  - **Lists**
  - **Sets**
  - **Hashes**
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Enables publish/subscribe communication patterns.
- **Client Libraries**: Simplified interaction through JavaScript and Python libraries.
- **CLI**: Terminal-based interface for direct command execution.
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

## 4. Architecture
- **Server**: Core component handling client requests, command processing, and data management.
- **Data Store**: In-memory storage optimized for quick data access and manipulation.
- **Client Interfaces**:
  - **JavaScript Library**: Facilitates integration with web applications.
  - **Python Library**: Enables usage within Python-based projects.
  - **CLI**: Provides direct interaction through the terminal.
- **Docker Container**: Encapsulates the server and its dependencies for consistent environments.

## 5. Client Libraries
- **JavaScript (`dushy-redis-lib.js`)**:
  - **Usage**: Connect, set/get values, manage data structures, and handle Pub/Sub.
  - **Installation**: `npm install dushy-redis-lib`
- **Python (`dushy_redis_lib.py`)**:
  - **Usage**: Similar functionalities tailored for Python applications.
  - **Installation**: `pip install dushy-redis-lib`
- **CLI**:
  - **Features**: Execute commands directly, manage data, and subscribe to channels.
  - **Usage Example**:
    ```
    ./redis-cli SET key value
    ./redis-cli GET key
    ```

## 6. Dockerization
- **Purpose**: Simplify deployment, ensure consistency across environments, and facilitate scalability.
- **Steps to Dockerize**:
  1. **Dockerfile**: Define the Docker image with necessary dependencies and configurations.
  2. **Build Image**: `docker build -t redis-clone .`
  3. **Run Container**: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis-clone`
- **Benefits**:
  - Easy setup and deployment.
  - Isolation from host environment.
  - Scalability and resource management.
